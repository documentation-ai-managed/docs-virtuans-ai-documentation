## AI Agent Architecture

Virtuans AI agents consist of three core layers: perception, reasoning, and action. The perception layer processes incoming messages from any channel. The reasoning engine uses natural language understanding to interpret intent and context. The action layer executes responses, API calls, or escalations.

  Agents maintain conversation state across sessions, ensuring context persists for `<24 hours` by default.

## Multi-channel Support

You deploy agents to multiple channels without changing configurations. Virtuans normalizes inputs from web chat, email, SMS, and voice into a unified message format.

## Automation Workflows

Create workflows to automate repetitive tasks like lead qualification. You define triggers, conditions, and actions visually in the Virtuans dashboard.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Trigger" icon="bell">
    Select events like "new message" or "user mentions booking".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Conditions" icon="filter">
    Check criteria such as `intent > 0.8` or CRM status.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Actions" icon="play">
    Send Slack notifications, update HubSpot, or book calendars.
  </Step>
